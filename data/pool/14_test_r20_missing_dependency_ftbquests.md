# Judging sheet 14: `r20_missing_dependency_ftbquests` (test)

- **Category:** `missing_dependency`  |  **Culprit:** `ftbquests`  |  **Acceptable:** ftbquests
- **What was broken:** disabled FTB Quests in CurseForge; the pack's KubeJS startup script cobblemon_quests.js (line 39) failed loading dev.ftb.mods.ftbquests.api.FTBQuestsAPI: class could not be found
- **Logs in this scenario:** r20_latest
- **Documents to judge:** 36

Judge the **document**, not the one chunk shown (open the URL if the excerpt does not settle it).
**Relevant** = someone with this exact crash would use it to diagnose or fix it: an issue about the same mod with the same kind of error, or a docs page that explains this specific error message. Generic pages that are merely on-topic don't count.
Mark `[x]` if the document helps diagnose or fix THIS failure; leave `[ ]` if not. Pool = union of the top-10 documents of six no-floor retrieval conditions, so a relevant document that none of them ranked in the top 10 is not here: add it by hand under *Added by hand* (and note how you found it).

If nothing is relevant after one deliberate search of the corpus, fill in **Support search** below.

**Support search:** `none_found` / `uncertain` / (leave blank if any doc is relevant)  ->

  - excerpt: [issue by gamebastian-creator] ### Bug Description Hello, I am experiencing a crash when launching Minecraft 1.21.1 on NeoForge with my modpack. I use Sable for Aeronautics, and Sable requires a newer version of Sodium. However, after installing the required Sodium version, the game crashes during startup. Environment: * Minecraft 1.21.1 * NeoForge 21.1.233 * Sable 2.0.3 * Aeronautics * Sodium 0.8.12-alpha.2+ (required by Sable) Because Sable requires this version of Sodium, removing Sodium is not a viable workaround for my setup. Could you please help determine whether this is a known

  - excerpt: [issue by Erdragh] I'm writing a Minecraft mod / Discord bot combo: https://github.com/Erdragh/AstralBot It uses [JDA](https://jda.wiki) to communicate with Discord. JDA has a dependency on okhttp3 which over multiple corners has a dependency on the kotlin stdlib. I'm excluding the `org.jetbrains.kotlin` dependency from JDA. I'm using Kotlin for the Mod itself and the build scripts. The Fabric server starts fine, the Forge server doesn't. To reproduce: - Clone repo mentioned above - Start the Forge server with the env variable `DISCORD_TOKEN` set to any value, just so it's defined.
