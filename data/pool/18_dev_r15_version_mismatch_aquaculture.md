# Judging sheet 18: `r15_version_mismatch_aquaculture` (dev)

- **Category:** `version_mismatch`  |  **Culprit:** `aquaculture`  |  **Acceptable:** aquaculture
- **What was broken:** updated Aquaculture 2 to the 26.1 build (Aquaculture-26.1.2-2.9.3.jar) in a 1.21.1 pack; it requires neoforge 26.1.0.0 or above, pack has 21.1.224
- **Logs in this scenario:** r15_crash, r15_latest
- **Documents to judge:** 55

Judge the **document**, not the one chunk shown (open the URL if the excerpt does not settle it).
**Relevant** = someone with this exact crash would use it to diagnose or fix it: an issue about the same mod with the same kind of error, or a docs page that explains this specific error message. Generic pages that are merely on-topic don't count.
Mark `[x]` if the document helps diagnose or fix THIS failure; leave `[ ]` if not. Pool = union of the top-10 documents of six no-floor retrieval conditions, so a relevant document that none of them ranked in the top 10 is not here: add it by hand under *Added by hand* (and note how you found it).

If nothing is relevant after one deliberate search of the corpus, fill in **Support search** below.

**Support search:** `none_found` / `uncertain` / (leave blank if any doc is relevant)  ->
