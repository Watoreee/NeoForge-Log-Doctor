# Judging sheet 18: `r19_version_mismatch_konkrete` (test)

- **Category:** `version_mismatch`  |  **Culprit:** `konkrete`  |  **Acceptable:** konkrete
- **What was broken:** replaced Konkrete with the Minecraft 1.21.11 build (konkrete_neoforge_1.9.15_MC_1.21.11.jar) in a 1.21.1 pack (1.21.11 vs 1.21.1 is easy to misread)
- **Logs in this scenario:** r19_crash, r19_latest
- **Documents to judge:** 33

Judge the **document**, not the one chunk shown (open the URL if the excerpt does not settle it).
**Relevant** = someone with this exact crash would use it to diagnose or fix it: an issue about the same mod with the same kind of error, or a docs page that explains this specific error message. Generic pages that are merely on-topic don't count.
Mark `[x]` if the document helps diagnose or fix THIS failure; leave `[ ]` if not. Pool = union of the top-N documents of six no-floor retrieval conditions, so a relevant document that none of them ranked in its top N is not here: add it by hand under *Added by hand* (and note how you found it).

If nothing is relevant after one deliberate search of the corpus, fill in **Support search** below.

**Support search:** `none_found` / `uncertain` / (leave blank if any doc is relevant)  ->
