# Design decisions and deviations

PLAN.md is frozen. Every deviation, clarification, and design choice is recorded here (2–3 lines each).

## Setup (Day 1)

**Repo root = project root, not `crashdoc/`.** PLAN 6.0 shows the layout under a `crashdoc/` folder; the
repo root *is* that folder (README, PLAN.md, `src/crashdoc/`, ... sit at the top level). The Python package
is still `src/crashdoc/`.

**`.env` loaded with python-dotenv.** Config stays env-only (PLAN 2): code reads `os.environ`; `python-dotenv`
just copies a local, git-ignored `.env` into the environment for convenience. Real env vars take precedence.

**TLS via the OS trust store (`truststore`).** On the dev machine, Python's bundled `certifi` CAs fail to verify
HTTPS (`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`) while the OS store succeeds (curl/git work), so something on the network
re-signs TLS. We call `truststore.inject_into_ssl()` instead of disabling verification. Verification stays on.

**Exact version pins in `requirements.txt`.** They are the versions development and evaluation ran on, so a clean
clone reproduces the same environment.

**Ruff line length 120.** Set explicitly on the command line for now; it moves to `pyproject.toml` with the skeleton.
